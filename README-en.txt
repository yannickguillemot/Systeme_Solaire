Flash Introduction Lesson Project.
By Yannick Guillemot and Quentin Grosperrin
Spring 2011

To launch the project :
application.exe for Windows
application.app for Max
or application.swf

It seems that the application works more smoothly using the .swf format. If you still have performance issues, try to relaunch the app or your computer.
